All completed coding assignments and various PDF lecture and wiki notes from Coursera ML course taught by Andrew Ng. 

Worked through it in my spare time for the fun of it - it's a really accessible treatment of most of the basic machine learning concepts and algorithms. 

Obviously I hope this isn't used for people to cheat in the course, but there are already sources of code public already. 

All .mat files for running the examples are included.
